## EXECUTION RULES

1. **Load each document one by one**.
2. For each document:
   - Read the first step.
   - Generate the required files, folders, migrations, APIs, or code as per instructions.
   - After completing a step:
     ```
     STOP.
     Confirm completion and testing before continuing.
     ```
   - Wait for my explicit confirmation before moving to the next step.
3. **Do not skip steps.** Even if you think it is done, stop and confirm.
4. If a dependency is missing, pause and guide me to fix it first.
5. Continue through all steps in the current document until it is 100% completed and tested.
6. When a document is finished:
   - Announce: "Document [filename] completed."
   - Then automatically load the next document and repeat.
