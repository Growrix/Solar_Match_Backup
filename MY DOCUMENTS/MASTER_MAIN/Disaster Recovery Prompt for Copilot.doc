# TASK: RESUME SOLARMATCH EXECUTION FROM LAST CHECKPOINT

We were executing the build using the validated execution plan files in:

MY DOCUMENTS\MASTER_MAIN\EXECUTIONTERMINAL\

We were working in strict order:

1. CriticalSecurityFixes.doc
2. DatabaseSchemaImplementation.doc
3. StripePaymentIntegration.doc
4. RealTimeChatSystem.doc
5. BiddingSystemImplementation.doc
6. QuoteVersioningSystem.doc
7. AIAssistantEnhancement.doc
8. AdminPanelDevelopment.doc
9. ProductionDeploymentSetup.doc
10. IntegrationTesting.doc

---

## RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Ask me where we left off** (which document and step).
2. Load that document and **resume exactly from the last confirmed "STOP & CONFIRM" checkpoint.**
3. Re-check all dependencies mentioned before that step.
4. If any files or migrations seem missing/corrupted, re-run that step safely before moving forward.
5. Continue execution using the same STOP-and-confirm flow.

---

## SAFETY RULES

- DO NOT skip steps, even if the code already exists. Always re-verify.
- If a migration or file already exists, verify content matches the instructions.
- After finishing the current document, continue with the next in sequence.

---

## GOAL

Pick up exactly where we left off and complete the entire build as if there was no interruption.

BEGIN RECOVERY PROCESS NOW.
