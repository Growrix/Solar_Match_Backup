## ⚙️ 4. LOGIC & DATA FLOWS

### 4.1 Authentication Flow
```
1. User visits public site
2. Clicks "Become Partner" → InstallerEligibilityForm
3. Passes eligibility → InstallerAuthModal (signup)
4. Account created → installer_users + installer_companies tables
5. Login → useInstallerAuth hook verification
6. Dashboard access granted
```

### 4.2 Lead Purchase Flow
```
1. Browse leads in LeadFeed → installer_leads table query
2. Select lead → Purchase modal with Stripe integration
3. Payment processed → installer_lead_purchases record created
4. Contact info revealed → lead status updated
5. Lead appears in PurchasedLeads → status tracking begins
```

### 4.3 Data Fetching Patterns
- **Authentication:** `useInstallerAuth` hook with Supabase queries
- **Lead Data:** Direct Supabase queries with RLS enforcement
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling-based (every 5s for leads)
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch with user-friendly error messages

### 4.4 Role-Based Access Control
```
middleware.ts → Route-level protection
useInstallerAuth → Component-level verification
Supabase RLS → Database-level security
localStorage → User type persistence
```
