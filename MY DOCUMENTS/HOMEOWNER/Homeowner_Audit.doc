## ⚙️ 4. LOGIC & DATA FLOWS

### 4.1 Authentication & User Management Flow
```
1. Public site visitor
2. Instant quote → triggers registration flow
3. AuthModal (signup/signin) → Supabase Auth
4. Profile creation → profiles table
5. User type assignment → localStorage + auth metadata
6. Dashboard access → role-based routing
7. Feature access → verification requirements
```

### 4.2 Quote Request Flow
```
1. InstantQuoteForm → property data collection
2. Quote calculation → lib/services/solarQuotes.ts
3. Quote type selection → call_visit vs written
4. Contact details → NewQuoteForm
5. Authentication check → force registration if needed
6. Quote submission → solar_quotes table
7. Lead generation → installer_leads table (automatic trigger)
8. Installer notification → lead available for purchase
```

### 4.3 Quote Comparison Flow (Written Quotes)
```
1. Installer purchases lead → installer_lead_purchases table
2. Installer submits quote → written_quotes table
3. Homeowner views quotes → WrittenQuotes.tsx
4. Quote comparison → side-by-side interface
5. Interest selection → "I'm Interested" trigger
6. Contact revelation → commission calculation (planned)
7. Chat unlock → direct communication
8. Negotiation → BiddingRoom interface (optional)
9. Deal acceptance → payment processing (planned)
```

### 4.4 Call/Visit Lead Flow
```
1. Call/Visit quote type selected → instant contact revelation
2. Lead purchase by installer → contact_revealed = true
3. Direct installer contact → phone/email communication
4. Site visit coordination → outside platform
5. Quote submission → installer generates written quote
6. Follow-up → normal written quote flow
```

### 4.5 Data Fetching Patterns
- **Authentication:** `useAuth` hook with Supabase session management
- **Quote Data:** Direct Supabase queries with RLS enforcement
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling-based (5-second intervals for chat)
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders and spinner components

### 4.6 Quota Management Logic
```
Call/Visit Quotes:
- Base: 3 quotes
- Referral bonus: +2 quotes
- Verification required after first quote
- Total possible: 5 quotes

Written Quotes:
- Base: 3 quotes  
- Admin granted: +1 quote (after using base 3)
- Referral bonus: +2 quotes
- Purchase option: unlimited (after using all free)
- Total free: 6 quotes
```
